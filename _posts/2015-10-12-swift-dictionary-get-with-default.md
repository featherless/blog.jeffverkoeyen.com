# Swift Dictionary: get with default

> This post is also available as a Swift playground at https://github.com/jverkoey/playgrounds.

Let's build a Dictionary extension that fills in empty keys with "default" values when accessed. This extension will replace the following logic:

```language-swift
if dictionary[key] == nil {
  dictionary[key] = DefaultValue()
}
let value = dictionary[key]!
```

with something that can be expressed in a single line.

## An implementation

Presented below is an extension of Dictionary that defines the mutating func `get`. Because we're always going to return *something*, we can make this `get` function return a non-optional `Value` type.

```language-swift
extension Dictionary {
  mutating func get(key: Key, @autoclosure withDefault value: Void -> Value) -> Value {
    if self[key] == nil {
      self[key] = value()
    }
    return self[key]!
  }
}
```

Some interesting things going on here:

- `value` is a closure so that we may lazily evaluate the parameter.
- `value` is also an [@autoclosure]. Autoclosures are a powerful language feature that implicitly turns arguments into closures. For example, rather than writing 

  `fn({SomeObject()})`

  you write

  `fn(SomeObject())`

  and `SomeObject()` will be implicitly wrapped in a closure for evaluation by the function at a later point. Use this feature sparingly and with great care.

Now we can write the following:

```language-swift
struct Device {
  func addObserver() -> String { return "added observer" }
}

var dictionary: [String: Device] = [:]
dictionary.get("foo", withDefault: Device()).addObserver()
```

## Array values can't be modified

Consider the following:

```language-swift
var dictionary: [String:[String]] = [:]
dictionary.get("foo", withDefault: []).append("bar")
```

If you attempt to run this code in a Playground you'll get the following error:

    Cannot use mutating member on immutable value: function call returns immutable value

If we ignore what it's saying and try to get it to compile, we might change the code to:

```language-swift
var dictionary: [String:[String]] = [:]
var strings = dictionary.get("foo", withDefault: [])
strings.append("bar")
```

But check out what happens when we print out `dictionary`:

```language-swift
["foo": []]
```

Our default array was stored, but "bar" isn't in it!

Why? **Arrays returned by functions in Swift are copies**. Modifications made to the return value will not be reflected in the dictionary's value.

So why, then, does the following code work?

```language-swift
var dictionary: [String:[String]] = [:]
dictionary["foo"] = []
dictionary["foo"]?.append("bar")
dictionary // result: ["foo": ["bar"]]
```

After all, we're using Dictionary's subscript function &mdash; isn't it copying the returned array which should result in the same behavior as our `get` function?

Interestingly enough: **it is returning a copy!** But there's some magic going on when we execute `dictionary[key]?.append("bar")`:

1. `dictionary`'s subscript `get` is called and the corresponding value is returned.
2. `.append("bar")` is then invoked on the returned value. The copy of the array that was returned now contains "bar".
3. And here's the interesting part: **subscript `set` is called with the modified array.**

These three steps give the illusion that we're modifying the array in-place. Note that, without step 3, the dictionary won't end up storing the modified array:

```language-swift
var dictionary: [String:[String]] = [:]
dictionary["foo"] = []
var array = dictionary["foo"]! // 1.
array.append("bar")            // 2.
// dictionary["foo"] = array   // 3.
dictionary // result: ["foo": []] when 3 is commented out
```

## A better solution

Armed with a better understanding of how in-place dictionary modifications work we can revisit our original implementation.

We'll use `subscript` because it allows for inline get/set semantics. But how do we provide a default value?

Tucked away in the [Swift 2 Subscripts documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Subscripts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH16-ID308) is our answer:

> Subscripts are not limited to a single dimension, and you can define subscripts with multiple input parameters to suit your custom type’s needs.

So let's rewrite our method using `subscript`:

```language-swift
extension Dictionary {
  subscript(key: Key, @autoclosure withDefault value: Void -> Value) -> Value {
    mutating get {
      if self[key] == nil {
        self[key] = value()
      }
      return self[key]!
    }
    set {
      self[key] = newValue
    }
  }
}
```

- `get` must be marked `mutating` in order to modify self.
- `set` must be implemented in order to support inline value modifications.

And this is how you use it:

```language-swift
dictionary["foo", withDefault: []].append("bar")
```

Much better!

## Final notes

I learned how subscript in-place modifications work by doing the following:

1. Created a new Playground.
2. Wrote a simple class with a subscript get/set implementation.
3. Added print statements to the get/set.
4. Wrote a simple example of what I wanted to achieve.

```language-swift
class Foo {
  var array: [String] = []
  subscript(name: String) -> [String] {
    get {
      print("get")
      return array
    }
    set {
      print("set")
      array = newValue
    }
  }
}


let f = Foo()
f["foo"].append("bar")
```

Much to my surprise, observing the logs revealed:

```
get
set
```

- A drawback to the subscript solution is that autocomplete will not help.
